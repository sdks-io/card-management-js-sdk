# Restriction Bundle Create

This API enables clients to create a new card bundle and apply restrictions.

#### Supported operations

* Create bundle and include mandatory -
  * Usage, day/time, product and location restrictions
  * List of cards to add to bundle
* Create bundle and include optional identifier of bundle in external system

#### Validation rules

The following are the key validation rules with the associated error codes for failed validation-

* `7012` - At least one card must be added to the bundle
* `7011` - The total number of cards passed in the input must be 500 or less.
* `7014` - All the cards passed in the input are part of the selected account.
* `7013` - At least one restriction must be applied to the bundle i.e. either of usage, day/time, location or product restriction.
* `7005` - Day time restriction cannot be set to restrict the use of a card on all days of the week.
* `7000` - Usage restriction of the bundle is not open ended i.e. all the limits within the usage restriction must not be set to 0/null.
* `7004` - In the usage restrictions, the limits per transaction should be less than or equal to Daily, Daily should be less than or equal to Weekly, Weekly should be less than or equal to Monthly. Exception being 0/blank will be skipped, i.e. Daily value should be less than equal to Monthly value if Weekly value is 0/blank.
* `0007` - Error returned if request parameters fail validation e.g. mandatory check.
